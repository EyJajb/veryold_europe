# Welcome to Newbie Europe Travel

* Our program's main purpose is to provide viewers with some background of some top tourist locations across the world

## How to use

* After running the code, you will be given an address in which you will be redirected to our website. On this website you will see multiple locations across the world with various hotspots.

### General files

* ReadMe.md- shows the details of our program

### Code files

* main.py - This runs the main menu and allows viewer to interact with project. Main.py contains all the app routes which connects to each html site.
* germany.html-this is the page of our website which provides information about Germany and its hotspots
* greece.html-this is the page of our website which provides information about Greece and its hotspots
* italy.html-this is the page of our website which provides information about Italy and its hotspots
* spain.html-this is the page of our website which provides information about Spain and its hotspots


### Directions for Mr.M
* Download/clone all files onto computer

* Run the project on a local server

* After running, you will see our main website. There are 3 catagories, one is our work in progress travel project, one is our old hello series and a link to this readme, and the other is a list of all our documents(journals, project ideas, etc.)

* Click on the travel website link which will take you to all the things we worked on this week. Please check out the code to these website for more information on how we did it.

* To find evidence of jinja, flask, and bootstrap, explore our github. (note:We tried to integrate a bootstrap navbar, but couldn't get it to show up. We will work on this next week)

* For evidence of intelij, we believe that the creation and running of this project will show that we used intelij. This is because flask and bootstrap are automaticly downloaded when we used intelij, compared to other code editors. This means that we wouldn't be able to make this project without it.

## October 30th Check-in
* Wesley-20/20 I didn't do much this week. We had a lot of technical problems, and were trying to get a navigation bar to work. In the end, we decided on making a new repository to work on merging our new website with our old one. I created a france.html, and helped get the porfolio on the new website. A lot of the week was learning how navigation bars worked.
* Ethan- 20/20. We decided to revert back pages to an earlier version so we could use the nav bar. What I've done was create a format for each page so we could keep the pages looking consistent. I've debugged some of Andrea's coding and also I've started using my RasberriPi nd trying things out.
* Andrea-
* Diego- 20/20. Our website was already advanced so we didn't need to add a lot.  We switched git hub pages so I brought my Greece page and the readme over from the other project.  I added hotels, airplanes and restraunts to my Greece page so that anyone who was visting the site and liked my page could start to look at planning a trip to Athens, Greece.
* Naweid-20/20. We didn't add much onto the website. Ethan created a template in which we could all use for our cities. This made all our pages similar and more appealing to the viewers. I added a top hotel as well as a top restaurant for this weeks addition to spain.html. With the help of my page, I hope viewers could see Barcelona as a location to put at the top of their list.
